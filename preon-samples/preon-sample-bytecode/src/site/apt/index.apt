  This example demonstrates using Preon to decode Java class files. It
defines an object model that was almost copied literally from the
{{{http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jvms/second_edition/html/ClassFile.doc.html}Class
File Specification}}, and uses Preon annotations to map it to its
encoded representation. Note that the sample does not contain a single
line of imperative code. 

  This is a snippet from the ClassFile's definition:

~~%{snippet|id=sample|file=src/main/java/nl/flotsam/preon/sample/bytecode/ClassFile.java}
